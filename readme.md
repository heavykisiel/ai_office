AI Office: Automated Code and App Development Framework
Overview

AI Office is a framework of collaborative AI agents designed to brainstorm, design, and develop code projects. The system allows users to:

    Learn app development and programming by analyzing generated code.
    Build apps that are profitable, impressive, or educational.
    Automate coding processes while focusing on design and logic understanding.

Features
Agent Roles

    Brainstorming Agents: Generate realistic, goal-oriented app ideas.
    Debating Agents: Discuss pros and cons of ideas and refine suggestions.
    System Architect Agents: Design app structures, including tech stacks and modular components.
    Developer Agents: Incrementally generate and improve code for app components.
    Evaluator Agents: Assess code quality, correctness, and performance.

Interactive Workflow

    Approve or reject brainstormed ideas.
    Participate in conflict resolution during debates.
    Review and approve commits before they are pushed to GitHub.

Key Functionalities

    Context Management:
        Agents are aware of project goals, specs, and your system configuration.
        Modular task handling for efficient token usage.
    State Persistence:
        Save and resume agent workflows, discussions, and decisions.
    Console Interface:
        Interactive CLI for reviewing agent suggestions and providing feedback.
    Logging and Documentation:
        Maintain logs of agent decisions, generated code, and revisions.

Workflow

    Brainstorming:
        Generate and discuss app ideas based on project goals.
        Use user-provided preferences and modern tech trends.
    Debating:
        Evaluate ideas, highlight pros and cons, and rank options.
        Resolve conflicts with user input when necessary.
    System Design:
        Create app architecture and define development tasks.
    Development:
        Incrementally generate, evaluate, and improve code.
        Submit commits with detailed explanations for approval.
    GitHub Integration:
        Approved code is automatically committed and pushed to a repository.

Setup
Requirements

    API: Hugging Face API (free tier: 5,000 requests/day).
    Libraries:
        transformers, torch, rich (for CLI).
        Optional: flake8 or similar tools for code evaluation.
    Hardware:
        Ensure sufficient compute power for running models.

Installation

    Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-office.git
cd ai-office

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure project settings in config.json:

    {
        "huggingface_api_key": "your_api_key",
        "working_directory": "/path/to/your/project",
        "gpu": "NVIDIA RTX 3060"
    }

Usage

    Start the console application:

    python ai_office.py

    Interact with agents:
        Approve/reject suggestions.
        Provide feedback during debates.
        Review and approve commits.

    Resume workflows after closure:
        The app automatically saves its state. On restart, previous progress will load.

Project Goals

    Primary Goal: Enable efficient, AI-driven code development while providing learning opportunities.
    Secondary Goals:
        Build profitable or impressive apps.
        Simplify workflows through automation and modular design.

Roadmap
Phase 1: Prototype

    Implement brainstorming agent and basic idea generation.
    Create CLI for user interaction.

Phase 2: Expand Functionality

    Add debating, architect, and developer agents.
    Introduce modular development and state-saving.

Phase 3: Full Workflow

    Integrate agents into a seamless pipeline.
    Add GitHub commit and push functionality.

Phase 4: Optimization

    Optimize token usage and improve model performance.
    Add a GUI interface for ease of use (optional).
