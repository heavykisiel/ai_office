Step-by-Step Plan
Setup and Environment

    Set up a new project directory with version control (e.g., Git).
    Install necessary dependencies and tools:
        Python and libraries: transformers, torch, rich, json, os.
        Set up a virtual environment.
    Obtain and configure the Hugging Face API key.
    Create a config.json file to store:
        API key.
        Working directory.
        System specifications (e.g., GPU, paths).

Core Framework

    Design the CLI structure:
        Create a main entry point (ai_office.py).
        Implement a menu system for user-agent interactions.
    Implement agent management:
        Define roles (Brainstormer, Debater, Architect, Developer, Evaluator).
        Create modular functions for each role.
    Set up a logging system:
        Log agent outputs, discussions, and decisions.
        Save logs to a file for future reference.

Brainstorming Phase

    Implement the Brainstorming agent:
        Use a Hugging Face text-generation model.
        Load project preferences and suggest app ideas.
    Enable user interaction for idea feedback:
        Approve, reject, or refine suggestions.

Debate and Refine Ideas

    Implement the Debating agent:
        Compare and rank brainstormed ideas.
        Present pros/cons and allow user to resolve conflicts.

System Design Phase

    Implement the System Architect agent:
        Design app structure (tech stack, components, and modules).
        Generate task breakdown for Developer agents.

Development Phase

    Implement the Developer agents:
        Incrementally generate code for app components.
        Evaluate and refine outputs using user feedback.
    Integrate the Evaluator agent:
        Check code correctness, performance, and clarity.

Code Management

    Implement commit preparation:
        Developers create commit-ready files.
        Include commit messages explaining changes.
    Add GitHub integration:
        Automatically push approved commits to a repository.

State Management

    Implement state-saving functionality:
        Save agent progress, logs, and workflow state to a file.
    Add state resumption:
        Reload the saved state upon restarting the app.

Optimization and Scaling

    Optimize context handling:
        Summarize files to reduce token usage.
        Implement dynamic content loading for large projects.
    Test the workflow with sample projects.
    Refactor code for scalability and maintainability.

Documentation

    Generate usage documentation:
        Document features, workflow, and CLI commands.
    Add developer documentation:
        Explain the code structure and agent interactions.

Future Enhancements (Optional)

    Implement GUI (e.g., using PyQt or Tkinter).
    Add real-time collaboration between agents.
    Explore additional AI models for specialized tasks.
